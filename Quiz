  //what i learned; I learned how to use if else statement to cjeck if a conditon is true or false and how to use multiple of them. 
  // i learned to make a how to track score/ an integer value whilest adding to it. 
  // how to use scanner to take the imput from uthe user using nextInt() = numbers and nextLine() = text
